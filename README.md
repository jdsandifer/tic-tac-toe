# Tic Tac Toe
The classic game written in JavaScript with help from Haml and Sass. I tried to stick to a functional programming style as much as possible for this project and used the Tic Tac Toe AI library created by Kacper (pietrzakacper on GitHub) for the AI.

You can play a game for yourself here: [Tic Tac Toe](https://codepen.io/jdsandifer/full/MrQgNX/).
